This solution has two Applications. One resident in the Lego Mindstorms (NXTHost) and the other in the PC (MexiLEGO).

To use it you first need to install LeJOS for NXT Brick on your computer. http://lejos.sourceforge.net/ (only works with NXT model)

The applications are distributed as Eclipse IDE projects and you must compile them.

To install LeJOS on your computer follow the instructions on http://lejos.sourceforge.net/nxt/nxj/tutorial/Preliminaries/UsingEclipse.htm

In MexiLEGO app may need to modify the path of the libraries according to your LeJOS installation.

The application supports only 32-bit operating systems due to the limitations of bluetooth drivers of LeJOS.

Steps to follow:

1.- Download the frimware of LeJOS into the Mindstorms.
2.- Pair bluetooth devices (Robot & PC)
3.- Compile applications.
4.- Download the NXTHost application and run it on the robot. (Connecting leyend appears on LCD Robot Display)
5.- On your computer run the MexiLEGO application. (This application will not start if it can not connect to the Bluetooth robot.)
